# Bluetooth_Circuit

The purpose of this task is to make the iPad inside the robot work when somebody stands at a certain distance from the robot. Ultra Sonic Distance is used to measure the distance. The first Arduino will measure the distance. If the sensor detects a person in 70 cm or less from the robot, it will wait for 2 seconds and then measure again. If still there is a person it will send a signal to another Arduino to work.

In this task, we used another Arduino instead of a Bluetooth device and a Piezo instead of an iPad.
